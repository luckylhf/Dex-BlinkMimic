## Dependencies and data

The Python dependencies (mjlab, MuJoCo, MuJoCo Warp, NVIDIA Warp, PyTorch, matplotlib, Pillow) are installed from
their own distributions under their own licenses (Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause and others) and are not redistributed here.
The LAFAN1 motions (Ubisoft La Forge, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) and the Unitree G1 description (BSD-3-Clause) are downloaded
by `tools/download_data.sh` and are not redistributed here either; files derived from LAFAN1 (videos, GIFs,
checkpoints) are not covered by this repository's MIT License.

The evaluation motions in `data/evaluation/supermimic_12341_v1/` are not dataset excerpts: they were produced by
extracting human motion from the GBTC / dance-boy / dance-girl videos and converting it to Dex robot motion. They are
not derived from BONES-SEED, LAFAN1 or any other motion dataset and are not used for training.

The BONES-SEED dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed) is a gated dataset under its own
`bones-seed-license`; no BONES-SEED motion data, motion names, statistics or receipts are redistributed in this
repository. Training on BONES-SEED requires obtaining the data directly from the publisher and accepting its terms.
